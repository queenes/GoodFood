        <h2>Garlic Butter Steak</h2>
        <p>Servings: 2</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 (2 inch thick) ribeye steak</li>
          <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons canola oil (or any other available)</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
          <li>3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
          <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
          <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 95 degrees C</p>
        <p>Generously season all sides of the steak with salt and pepper</p>
        <p>Transfer to a wire rack on top of a baking sheet, then bake for about 45 minutes to an hour </p>
        <p>until the internal temperature reads about 52 degrees C for rare. Adjust the bake time based </p>
        <p>on if you like your steak more rare or more well-done.</p>
        <p>Heat the canola oil in a pan over high heat until smoking. Do not use olive oil, as its smoke point is </p>
        <p>significantly lower than that of canola oil and will smoke before reaching the desired cooking temperature.</p>
        <p>Sear the steak for 30 seconds on the first side, then flip.</p>
        <p>Add the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme and swirl around the pan. Transfer the garlic and herbs on top </p>
        <p>of the steak and baste the steak with the butter using a large spoon.</p>
        <p>Baste for about 30 seconds, then flip and baste the other side for about 15 seconds.</p>
        <p>Turn the steak on its side and cook to render off any excess fat.</p>
        <p>Rest the steak on a cutting board or wire rack for about 10 minutes. Slicing the steak before the resting </p>
        <p>period has finished will result in a lot of the juices leaking out, which may not be desirable.</p>
        <p>Slice the steak into Â½ -nch strips, then fan out the slices and serve!</p>
